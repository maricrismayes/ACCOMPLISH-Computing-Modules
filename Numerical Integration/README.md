# This module was created by Dr. Zheng Chen of UMass Dartmouth, and can be adopted in the following courses

The goal of this module is to build a graphical user interface (GUI) in MATLAB to approximate integrations. Covered numerical integration methods include Midpoint Rule, Trapezoidal Rule, Simpon's Rule, Simpson's 3/8 Rule, Composite Numerical Integration, and Monte Carlo Integration

# GUI Input 
The user will input the formula of the integrand function, the range of integration, and choose a numerical integration method. 

# Workflow and students' tasks
The framework of this GUI is provided to students in the file "integration_GUI.m". The full version is provided to the instructor, and the students will work on the student version with parts of the code being blank.

The student's mission is to study different numerical integration methods and finish the subroutines/functions for each methods. The blank parts are under the routine "function Calculate_pushbutton_Callback(hObject, eventdata, handles)".
