# This module was created by Dr. Maricris Mayes of UMass Dartmouth, and can be adopted in the following courses

This is an module on plotting multivariable functions using Mathematica. We illustrate it by plotting the wavefunction for the particle in a box 
and their corresponding probability densities. We also show contour plots of two and three variables, with important examples in chemistry such as 
atomic and molecular orbitals. 

The Mathematica notebook is included together with an introduction and the exercise, both in pdf.
