PHY 113 - Classical Physics I

This is a gentle introduction to algorithmic thinking, with an application to projectile motion, suitable for students who have not yet taken a computer 
programming course. Everything is embedded in a Jupyter notebook, including a self-guided quickstart introduction on how to use Jupyter. There is also a 
basic introduction to the concept of physical models, broadly conceived.

It features an interactive widget interface where students can vary parameters and run a simulation of projectile motion to compare 
against a recorded result or an in-lab experiment.
