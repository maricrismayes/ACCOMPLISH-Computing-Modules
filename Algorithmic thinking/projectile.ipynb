    "In this laboratory, you will explore the properties of projectile motion. In lectures, we learned how to solve for the position and velocity of a projectile, using Newton's Second Law of Motion and algebraic mathematical methods. In this exercise, we will explore an alternate route to projectile motion, using a simple _algorithm_, which uses the initial position and velocity of the projectile to find its location a short instant in time later.\n",

We will see that this numerical algorithm, called _numerical integration_, can not only approach the limit of the continuous trajectory found in lecture, but it can also easily include other physical effects, such as air resistance, which are much trickier to solve for using analytical mathematical methods. The tremendous speeds of modern computers makes these numerical integration procedures highly practical for a wide range of applications in science and engineering.\n",

    "Think of this file as a kind of electronic notebook. It is organized into individual cells (like this one), which can contain text, images, and code. This notebook is written in the Python 3 language, but you can also structure Jupyter notebooks around other languages, including Java, R, Julia, Matlab, and many, many more -- over a 100 languages in total! Jupyter refers to these language options, which can also include different versions of the same language, as \"kernels\".\n",

    "Some cells are input cells, which contain code which you can run. You'll notice these cells immediately by the \"In [ ]:\" which appears to the left of the cell. _To run the cell, press and hold the shift key, and press the return button (‚áß Shift + ‚Üµ Return)._ This is the **most** important rule to remember when using a Jupyter notebook! ü§ì\n",

The best way to access these additional features is through the context-sensitive help system available directly from Jupyter. Ctrl + Shift + P on Linux and Windows (Cmd + Shift + P on Mac OS/X). This dialog box helps you run any command by name -- just type in the first few characters of the command you wish to execute, and a range of options will be presented.\n",

That big task -- cooking the pasta -- can be broken down into separate subtasks, such as boiling the water, cooking the pasta until done, adding sauce, plating the food, and so on. That set of steps can be thought of a set of rules to cook pasta. \n",

In the sciences and engineering, algorithms typically refer to a formal set of logical steps used to compute a result. You've used algorithms for many years, even if you've never used that name before. For example, when adding two numbers there is a formal process you learned which looks like:\n",
    "\n",

    "    * If there is another column to the left of this one, move to the left one column, and add the carried digit to the column\n",
    "    * If there are no other columns, write down the carried digit in the summed number and go to step 3.\n",
    "3. End -- the result written down is the sum of the two numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see that the complete algorithm for even a simple process like adding two numbers can be lengthy and involved, with logical decisions (eg, is there another column to be added) and detailed processes (eg, carry the 10's digit to the next column) to be followed precisely. The detailed steps given by the algorithm enable us to translate these into code that can be executed automatically by a computer. _Note, however, that an algorithm is not a computer code._ An algorithm is intended to be read and understood by humans, not computers.\n",

    "In the next box, we include a short Python routine to build up the entire trajectory for the simplest case of a vertically-dropped ball by simply repeating this process of computing the new positions and velocities over and over. Scientists and mathematicians call this process _numerical integration_. The details of this script are not so important right now, but note the basics of how the Python code works -- it defines the initial conditions, and then loops over time to find the new positions and velocities. Once those are computed, it plots up the results and compares these against the exact solution we found in class."

The simplest thing you could imagine doing would be to just sum up the differences between the numerical and the exact solution. Let's use the notation we adopted previously, with individual subscripts representing each of $N$ timesteps, so that $y_0$ is the initial timestep, $y_1$ the second, $y_2$ the third, and so on, up to $y_N$, the last step.
